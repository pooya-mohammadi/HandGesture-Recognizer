# Model Development
A CNN model was implemented and trained using the collected dataset. To ensure robustness and avoid overfitting, K-Fold cross-validation technique was employed during model training.

# Model Evaluation
After training, the model was evaluated on a separate test dataset. The evaluation results showed that the model achieved an accuracy of 50% on the test data.
